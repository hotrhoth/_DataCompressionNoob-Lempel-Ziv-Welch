LZ77 and LZ78 are the two most common lossless data compression algorithms, which Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv published in 1977\cite{doc3} and 1978 \cite{doc1}. They are sometimes referred to as LZ1 and LZ2 respectively. These two theoretical dictionary algorithms form the basis for many variations including LZW, LZSS, and others. Additionally, they are also the basis of several ubiquitous compression schemes, including GIF and the DEFLATE algorithm used in PNG.
