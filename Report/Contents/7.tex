The Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm, developed in 1984 by Abraham Lempel, Jakob Ziv, and Terry Welch, is a pivotal contribution to the field of lossless data compression. Renowned for its ability to efficiently reduce file sizes without losing information, LZW has become indispensable in various domains, including its prominent use in the GIF image format and the Unix compression utility compress.

As a dictionary-based compression algorithm, LZW optimizes storage and transmission by identifying repetitive patterns in the data and replacing them with shorter codes. This approach enables it to handle text, images, and other data types effectively, making it versatile for both general-purpose and specialized applications.
